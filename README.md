## Projects

Code editor written in Object Pascal that used [Scintilla](https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html) under the hood, it was the first open-source project I joined.
I joined it when it already existed, but contributed a lot with code and ideas, such as the transition from procedural code to an object oriented approach.

[![Notes Editor](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=jonasraoni&repo=notes)](https://github.com/jonasraoni/notes)

A source of manually minified JavaScript codes written with a friend a long time ago when I had plenty of spare time (abandoned, but I'm still using some codes from there ü•∞).

## How I Code/Solve Problems:

I've left a description of my approaches and reasoning while trying to improve the performance of this code in this repository:

## Random Facts

- I got my first computer when I was around 10 years old, a 486-DX2. I've learned how to use it by spying my cousin giving classes about DOS (not DoS üëÄ), so I still remember something about: `devicehigh=xyz`, `deltree`, typing `win` to start the Windows 3.11, turbo button, sound blaster kit, cleaning the mouse ball, zipdrive, SCSI (the super fast disk that nobody had üòÅ), etc.
- I've got access to the computer after finding the key (yeah, computers had locks) and discovering the password (which was errrrr "password" üëÄ).
- I've joined the internet after listening to some guys discussing about it and HTML in the classroom... I've got curious and once I arrived at home, I found an AOL CD and installed it, but well, it required a modem... Hopefully I remembered my cousin was talking about it, when he was setting up a Dial-Up connection to play Duke Nukem online (a real WTF at the time and, I still don't know from where he took all this knowledge haha), so I found a great 13.4 Kbps modem in a box with old hardware pieces, cut some cables and it just worked! I still remember about using the internet at night to save money, losing the connection when someone was calling and the introduction of "download resumers" was awesome üòé
- My key languages are JavaScript, C# and PHP, and in the past it used to be different (errr Object Pascal + C/C++).
- I still feel proud about my old codes, since I've created a binary parser (which was used by the [MongoDB Driver](http://christiankvalheim.com/project/mongodb-native/#credits:2d4bed8c133910cf12f420f60fbee804)), a big number library and other things in JS, some years before they were introduced to the language, it's cool when you get random (as I totally didn't need these things) ideas and make them work =]
- I don't have a specific preference to work in the backend/frontend, I consider that I have good taste/opinions, but I'm definetely not into design...
- I've been working remotely since 2015, and I fully recommend it =]
- I took part into the [contest where the creator of JQuery](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/09/addevent_recodi.html#c2757) (John Resig) was starting to become popular haha.
- I've started reading about web stuff around 1997... It was the time when everybody was using AOL, chatting rooms (who knew how to write rainbow texts was considered a hacker haha), Yahoo Groups, SubSeven (o_O) and etc... I've got a 30-50 pages document and it was just enough to learn HTML/CSS, it was also talking about JavaScript, but I didn't get the idea... Errrrrr, not until I discovered it was used to create those cool mouse trails, blinking radios and etc. üòÇ
- I've won a video game championship (and some internally at my worker place) when I was a child, the old guys which lost for me, were praising me as a god üòÇüèÜ
- My first paid task was digitizing monographies when I was around 13, nothing to complain xD
- My first programming language was JavaScript.
- My favorite type of task is improving performance and diving into weird bugs.
- My first home page is still accessible through the https://archive.org, but I'll never reveal its address! Some close friends must still remember about it üëÄ
- I've got my first programming job around 2001, a kind of freelance job to work on the integration of a machine to test the cushioning system of cars using Object Pascal/Delphi (I didn't receive my last paycheck üòë). After that I've moved to another company which was building hardware to teach children, doing the same type of job... At a certain time, I've decided to join a university (which was just finished around 2014 due to the creation of remote courses)... There I was solving the exercises using minified codes in C, the teacher got interested in my skills and indicated me to work in a company which was developing mobile applications in C/C++. After that I've moved to a digital agency and I've been working with web related technology since then, mostly using C#, PHP and JavaScript.
- I've been once a victim of a kind of social engineering attack when I was 16, a friend of mine sent me a game that he made to take a look, which had a hidden keylogger haha... Hopefully he warned me later! I was looking for him in internet these days, and he's famous for earning a lot of prizes in online promotions, even a car haha... I have a small guess about how he got the prizes üëÄ
- I've been once a victim of a ransomware as well! Someone connected to my MySQL database years ago and renamed the databases to form a message asking for money (after that I've finally became a bit psycho with security) üí©
- My favorite PC games were Euro Fighter 2000 (a flight simulator), Full Throttle, Indiana Jones, Quake, Duke Nukem and Warcraft, countless hours spent on them... The most revolutionary one was Carmageddon, my family was just shocked! Then it came a lot of trash games + the infinite Battlefield/Counter-Strike (I was the AK guy) seasons, which were then replaced by eternal (successful, but full of hatred against the game's AI) FIFA seasons, until I got retired from games üòÇ
- I don't trust in the current state of crypto currency, but digital money is here to stay (I can't remember last time I've touched bills/coins)... Also descentralization in general sounds great given our failed leaderships.
